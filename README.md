## Compiling Instruction 

To compile the code, first make sure CMake is installed. 

To build the library on Linux or macOS:
```sh
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../ -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
make
```
Then you can run a CCD example:
```bash
./Tight_Inclusion_bin 
```
We also provide you an example to run the [Sample Queries](https://github.com/Continuous-Collision-Detection/Sample-Queries) using our CCD method. You may need to install `gmp` before compiling the code. Then set the CMake option `TIGHT_INCLUSION_WITH_TESTS` as `ON` when compiling:
```sh
cmake ../ -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DTIGHT_INCLUSION_WITH_TESTS=ON
make
```
Then you can run `./Tight_Inclusion_bin` to test the `handcrafted queries` in the Sample Queries.
## Usage
Include `#include <tight_inclusion/inclusion_ccd.hpp>`

To check edge-edge ccd, use `bool edgeEdgeCCD_double();`

To check vertex-face ccd, use `bool vertexFaceCCD_double();`

ðŸ’¡ If collision is detected, the ccd function will return `true`, otherwise, the ccd function will return `false`. Since our method is CONSERVATIVE, if the returned result is `false`, we guarantee that there is no collision happens. If the result is `true`, it is possible that there is no collision but we falsely report a collision, but we can guarantee that this happens only if the minimal distance between the two primitives in this time step is no larger than `tolerance + ms + err`. We wil explain these parameters below.  

For both edge-edge ccd and vertex-face ccd, the input CCD query is presented by 8 vertices which are in the format of `Eigen::Vector3d`. Please read our code in `tight_inclusion/inclusion_ccd.hpp` for the correct input order of the vertices. 
Beside the input vertices, there are some input and output parameters for users to tune the performace or to get more CCD information. here is a list of the explanation of the parameters:

```
input:
    err         The numerical filters of the x, y and z coordinates. It measures the errors introduced by floating-point calculation.
    ms          Minimum separation distance no less than 0. It guarantees that collision will be reported if the distance between the two primitives is less than ms.
    tolerance   User-specific solving precision. It is the target maximal x, y, and z length of the inclusion function. We suggest the user to set it as 1e-6
```
