## Compiling Instruction 

To compile the code, first make sure CMake is installed. 

To build the library on Linux or macOS:
```sh
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../ -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
make
```
Then you can run a CCD example:
```bash
./Tight_Inclusion_bin 
```
We also show you an example to run the [Sample Queries](https://github.com/Continuous-Collision-Detection/Sample-Queries) using our CCD method. You may need to install `gmp` before compiling the code. When compiling the code, you need to set the CMake option `TIGHT_INCLUSION_WITH_TESTS` as `ON`:
```sh
cmake ../ -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DTIGHT_INCLUSION_WITH_TESTS=ON
make
```
Then you can run `./Tight_Inclusion_bin` to test the `handcrafted queries` in the Sample Queries.
## Usage
Include `#include <tight_inclusion/inclusion_ccd.hpp>`

To check edge-edge ccd, use `bool edgeEdgeCCD_double();`

To check vertex-face ccd, use `bool vertexFaceCCD_double();`
ðŸ’¡ If collision is detected, the ccd function will return `true`, otherwise, the ccd function will return `false`. Since our method is conservative, if the returned result is `false`, we guarantee that there is no collision happens. If the result is `true`, it is possible that there is no collision but we falsely report a collision, but we can guarantee that this happens only if the minimal distance between the two premitives in this time step is no larger than `tolerance + ms + err`. We wil explain these parameters below.  
For both edge-edge ccd and vertex-face ccd, the input CCD query is presented by 8 vertices which are in the format of `Eigen::Vector3d`. Please read our code in `tight_inclusion/inclusion_ccd.hpp` for the correct input order of the vertices. 
Beside the input vertices, there are plenty of input and out parameters for users to
